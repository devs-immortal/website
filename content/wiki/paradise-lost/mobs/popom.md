A group of Popoms grazing on Cloudsbluff flowers in the Highlands.

## Behavior
Popoms are passive animals that love to eat flowers and will seek out nearby flowers that they can reach as long as their fur is not fully saturated. 
They will randomly meander around if no flowers are available to eat. 
Their jelly can be eaten to provide a small instant heal, can be used to craft **Halflight Cheesecake**, or can be used to brew **Potions of Health Boost**.

### Flower Consumption
Whenever a Popom consumes a flower, it's fur fills out with jelly, able to store up to four flowers worth of jelly before they stop eating. When a Popom's fur is at it's 3rd or 4th stage, you can harvest the jelly by right clicking them. **The 4th stage yields the most jelly**.

### Breeding
Popoms are tempted and bred with any small flower items.

## Spawn Locations
Popoms can be found in the following biomes:
* [Highlands](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/highlands/) (common)
* [Wisteria Woods](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/wisteria-woods/) (common)
* [Highlands Forest](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/highlands-forest/) (uncommon)

## Drops

When harvested by right clicking, a Popom either drops **1-2** or **2-4** jelly if it's fur is at it's 3rd or 4th stage respectively.

When killed, a Popom will drop it's jelly (as above) as well as **1-3** white or magenta wool.
