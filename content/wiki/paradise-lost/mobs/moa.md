Two different colored packs of Moas in a Highlands Forest.

## Behavior
Moas are passive animals that are found in nearly every biome of Paradise. They can be tamed and ridden like horses, with a jump and glide movement style that helps with traversing the shattered islands of the dimension or with travelling quickly in the Overworld. Each biomes has a unique set of colors and patterns that moas can spawn with, and specific combinations of Moa can be bred to get other colors and breeding exclusive patterns. 

To see a full list of Moa spawn colors and breeding percentages, check out the **[Moa Breeding Guide](/wiki/paradise-lost/guides/moa-breeding/)**.

### Taming
Moas can be tamed by feeding them any **Raw Meat** items. Once tamed, a Moa has an inventory much like a Horse/Donkey/Mule and can be saddled and/or equipped with a chest to provide 20 storage slots.

### Moa Stats
Each Moa has six associated stats that can be checked with an **Olvite Bloodstone**:
* **Ground Speed** is the movement speed while on the ground
* **Gliding Speed** is the horizontal movement speed while in the air and gliding
* **Gliding Decay** is the rate at which a Moa descends while gliding
* **Jumping Strength** is the height that a Moa goes when jumping
* **Drop Multiplier** increases the amount of meat drops, between **1** and **6**
* **Max Health** represents the maximum health this Moa has, between **7.5 hearts** and **20 hearts**

### Breeding
Moas are tempted and bred with **Oranges** harvested from Orange trees. The offspring will have an equal chance of inheriting the pattern of each parent unless a special breeding result exists. Consult the **[Moa Breeding Guide](/wiki/paradise-lost/guides/moa-breeding/)**. Children will inherit improved stats from their parent meaning that the children will have **equal or better stats**.

Breeding Moas does not immediately spawn the child, instead dropping a Moa Egg that must be incubated in either an **Incubator** or **Moa Nest** block. Incubation is affected by multiple factors, which you can read about in the **[Incubation Guide](/wiki/paradise-lost/guides/incubation/)**.


## Spawn Locations
Moas can be found in the following biomes:
* [Autumnal Tundra](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/autumnal-tundra/) (common)
* [Continental Plateau](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/continental-plateau/) (common)
* [Highlands](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/highlands/) (common)
* [Highlands Forest](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/highlands-forest/) (common)
* [Highlands Grand Glade](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/highlands-thicket/) (common)
* [Wisteria Woods](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/wisteria-woods/) (common)
* [Highlands Shield](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/highlands-shield/) (uncommon)
* [Highlands Thicket](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/highlands-thicket/) (uncommon)

## Drops

When killed, a Moa will drop **0-3** Feathers and **1-6** Moa Chop depending on the Moa's **Drop Multiplier** stat.
