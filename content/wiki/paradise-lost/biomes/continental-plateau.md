A large expanse of Continental Plateau.

## Features
The Continental Plateau is a common cold biome in Paradise. 

It is a relatively flat biome with flowery ground flora intermixed with patches of snow and ice.
Small Mottled Aurel trees can be found rarely, short ice spikes generate in small clusters, and floestone boulders can rarely be found partially buried in the ground.
