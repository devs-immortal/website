## Features
The Highlands Thicket Biome is a rare biome found in Paradise. 

Highlands Thickets are generally large, spanning a large area with Large Aurels that block most light from reaching the forest floor. Large patches of Liverwort, Grass, and leaf piles cover the ground. Mother Aurel trees generate rarely but can be easily spotted from their luminous gold colored leaves.
Large boulders can be found occasionally and are sometimes made of golden Floestone.
