## Features
The Highlands Biome is one of the most common biomes in Paradise. 

It is a relatively flat biome with a variety of ground flora: grass, bushes, leaf piles and flowers.
Small and Medium Aurel trees dot the surface of the biome, and small floestone boulders can occasionally be found partially buried in the ground.
