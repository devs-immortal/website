## Features
The Highlands Shield Biome is a common biome in Paradise. 

It is notable for it's tall yellow Mottled Aurel trees and stony surface.
This biome is densely forested but has less flora, instead having more surface stone and small water pools throughout the biome. Rootcaps can be found frequently growing off of the Mottled Aurel trees and Honey Nettles can be found growing in the water pools. Despite having less flora, there are still grassy areas that generate where patches of Flax grows.
