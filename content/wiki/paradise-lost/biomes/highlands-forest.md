A hilly area of a Highlands Forest

## Features
The Highlands Forest Biome is one of the most common biomes in Paradise. 

It is a hilly biome with a variety of ground flora: short grass, bushes, leaf piles and flowers.
Small and Medium Aurel trees generate in clusters and small floestone boulders can be found partially buried in the ground. Pink Wisteria trees generate very rarely in this biome.
