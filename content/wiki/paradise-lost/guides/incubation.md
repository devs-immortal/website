Two Moa eggs incubating on the porch of a small house.

## Obtaining Moa Eggs
Breeding two [Moas](/wiki/paradise-lost/mobs/moa/) does not immediately spawn a child, but instead drops a Moa Egg that must be incubated in either an **Incubator** or **Moa Nest** block. 

### Hatch Time
Hatch time is determined by the biome where the incubation is taking place. Incubating in warmer biomes is easier and thus hatching will be quicker.
The hatch time varies from **10 minutes** in the coldest biomes to just **2 minutes** in the hottest biomes.

### Decreasing Hatch Time
The hatch time of an egg can be decreased down by **30%** with a warming light and bedding:
* Adding a **Cherine Torch** or **Cherine Lantern** one or two blocks above the incubator will reduce hatch time by **20%**
* Adding a bedding block (**Amadrys Bundle**, **Thatch**, or **Hay Bale**) underneath the incubator will reduce hatch time by **10%**
