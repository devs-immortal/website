**Clay** is a block that can be found abundantly in [lush caves](), less commonly in shallow surface water or created from mud using [pointed dripstone]().
It can be smelted into [terracotta]() or broken into [clay balls]() which are smeltable into [bricks]().

## Obtaining

### Breaking

Clay blocks can be mined with any item, but [shovels]() are quickest. Destroying a clay block yields 4 [clay balls]().
If broken with a tool enchanted with [Silk Touch](), it drops itself instead. Destroying a clay block with a tool enchanted with [Fortune]() does not increase the amount of clay dropped.

### Natural generation

Clay is most commonly found underwater in [swamps](), [beaches](), [oceans](), and at the bottoms of rivers and lakes in shallow, crystal-shaped disks, disregarding adjacency to other types of blocks.
