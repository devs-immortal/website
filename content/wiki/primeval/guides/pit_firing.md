Pit Firing is the first way to fire clay into bricks, clay molds, jugs, pots, and more. You will have to do a lot of pit firing in the early game. 

### How to Pit Fire

- Collect some straw, logs, and clay.
- Place a single straw into a hole in the ground that is surrounded with dirt on all 4 sides.
- Right click the unfired clay items onto the straw to place them in the pit. There will be room for 4 items.
- Once all your items are placed, right click several more times with straw to fill up the hole until no more can be placed.
- Place 4 logs into the pit by right clicking into the straw again. This should fill it up to the top.
- Using two sticks, light the top on fire, and wait for the process to complete. 
- After it is finishedd, the items will be in a pile of ashes that can be dug up with a shovel.

### Pit Firing Tips

- Pit Firing will take about 1 minecraft day, depending on how many items are being fired. If you need items as fast as possible, fire fewer items at a time
- Designate an area for firing and dig a grid of holes to easily run and organize multiple pit kilns at once

### Pit Firing Ores

To create your first tools and begin to cast metal parts, you will need to use a pit kiln to melt your metals down. 

- You will need to follow the same process of setting up regular Pit Firing.
- Get a Fired Clay Vessel. Clay vessels can be right clicked on while holding items in the inventory to add items into them (like a bundle).
- Once you've added enough metal items and are ready to cook it, place it in the Pit Kiln like firing any other item.
- After firing completes, the vessel will be filled with molten metal, comprised of whatever metal items were added to to vessel before firing.
- If you only added one type of metal, it will have been melted. If not, and the ratios of metals matches an alloy, that alloy will be created.

### How to fill Molds

- With a vessel full of molten metal, right clicking over a clay mold will remove one ingot's worth of metal from the vessel and place it in the mold.
- Molds take different amounts of metal to fill, based on what the vanilla counterpart would require.
- Once enough metal is in the mold, you can craft the filled mold into the corresponding tool part.
- **If you accidentally fill the wrong mold or can't fill it all the way, a partially filled mold can be crafted into metal chunks equivalent to the amount of metal contained, and the chunks can be re-melted in a vessel again.**
