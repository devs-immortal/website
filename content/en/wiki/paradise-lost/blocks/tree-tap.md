A Player's base using tree taps to get infinite Mushroom Stew and to fill Water Bottles for brewing.

## Function
Tree Taps allow for specific items to be created more easily. Tree Taps support hopper input and output, and have Comparator support.

Tree Taps will "Fill" items placed in the Tree Tap with different fluids depending on the block being tapped. Some recipes will change the tapped block, which means that the block can only be tapped one time before needing to be swapped out. See the recipes below for details.
