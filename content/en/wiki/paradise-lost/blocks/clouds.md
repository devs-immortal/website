All 3 types of clouds naturally generated along a cliffside.

## Function
Cloud blocks have unique properties when entities collide with them.

### Cold Cloud
Entities will sink into Cold Clouds but not fall out of them, and can be used for easily negating all fall damage without messing with flowing water or other solutions.

### Blue Cloud
Blue Clouds fling all entites that collide with them 18 blocks up in the air, making for one of the quickest vertical travel methods in the game.

### Golden Cloud
Golden Clouds forcefully fling all entites that collide with them downwards, inflicting fall damage if the ground is not soft. When placed with no space below, there is no effect on entities.

## Obtaining
Cloud blocks are found very commonly at all elevations in Paradise. Some biomes may have different proportions of clouds, and the biggest clouds are often near the bottom or top of the dimension.
