A Popom crossing the void in a levitating Minecart.

## Function
Levita Rails are crafted with Levita Beads and allow for floating Minecart travel.

### Levitating a Minecart
When powered (or activated by an adjacent Activator Rail), a Minecart that passes over it will temporarily be levitated causing it to not lose speed, change direction, or change height. If it encounters a rail in it's path it will snap to it but can continue levitating from those rails as long as it still has levitation time, so you can place bent normal rails to cahnge the direction of levitating Minecarts without needing a Levita Rail at every turn.

After levitating a Minecart, Levita Rails deactivate for 6 seconds and cannot levitate another Minecart until enough time has passed.

When passing over a Levita Rail at maximum speed, a Minecart will float for just over 32 blocks of distance. Passing over multiple Levita Rails will add 32 for each rail, allowing you to cross gaps of any size by just using more Levita Rails.

All types of Minecarts can be levitated, and riding Minecarts or placing mobs in Minecarts does not slow them or reduce the levitation distance.

### De-Levitating a Minecart
When unpowered, a Levita Rail will immediately stop a Minecart from levitating, in cases where you need a distance shorter than 32 blocks.

## Obtaining
Levita Rails are crafted similar to normal rails but with 2 Levita Beads added. They are crafted in batches of 12 so that you have many rails to work with even if you don't have many Levita Beads.
