A large setup for creating Bloomed Calcite, with several brewing stands to make the Potions of Healing required.

## Function
Bloomed Calcite is primarily used to create portals to Paradise, but also can be used to boost the speed of crop growth by placing it underneath the soil of a crop.

When placed below a Farmland block with a crop planted atop, Bloomed Calcite will accellerate the growth of that crop to 133%. Multiple Bloomed Calcite blocks will not accelerate a crop further than 133%.


## Obtaining
Bloomed Calcite is created with Potions of Healing (I or II does not make a difference).

Right clicking a normal Calcite block with a Potion of Healing will convert it to Bloomed Calcite, or Splash and Lingering Potions of Healing can be thrown onto Calcite to convert it. When using Splash or Lingering Potions, there is a 50% chance to convert an additional adjacent block of Calcite, making that the most efficient way to create Bloomed Calcite.
