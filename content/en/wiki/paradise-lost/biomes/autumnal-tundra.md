A large expanse of Autumnal Tundra.

## Features
The Autumnal Tundra is an uncommon cold biome in Paradise. 

It is a relatively flat biome, blanketed with snow but filled with flowery ground flora growing out of frozen soil. This biome's soil is Permafrost instead of normal dirt, requiring a bit longer to break with the same tools.
Small Mottled Aurel trees can be found rarely, and small ice spikes frequently poke out of the ground.
