A Vault treasure room guarded by an Enlightened Envoys

## Description
Vaults are rare, fully buried structures built to conceal and protect it's inhabitants and their culture. This structure has three distinct levels:
* The **Complex** is the uppermost floor and has wooden floors, mostly made up of living and working areas
* The **Garden** is the middle floor and is made mostly of stone with many wall mounted farms for growing crops
* The **Catacomb** are narrow, clautrophobic tunnels that snake underneath the structure

This Structure is sparsely populated, but the few [Envoys](/wiki/paradise-lost/mobs/envoy/) you find will be **Enlightened** and more difficult to kill. Most of the good loot will be found in the **Complex** but the other two levels also have secrets to be uncovered.

One of the best ways to find this structure is to find a **Vault Explorer Map** in the chest of an [Aurel Tower](/wiki/paradise-lost/structures/aurel-tower/).

### Glazed Gold
The structure exclusive loot that makes this structure worth looting are the **Glazed Gold Upgrade** smithing templates and **Glazed Gold** equipment.
**Glazed Gold** is an upgraded version of gold tools, retaining the high enchantability and mining speed but raising the mining level and durability to be on par with iron. 

They make great enchantment-specific tools as they are easy to get rare enchantments on and are quite cheap, once you have the smithing templates.
