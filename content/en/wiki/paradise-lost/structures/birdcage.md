A mostly exposed Birdcage dug into an uneven cliff.

## Description
Birdcages are rare structures that usually spawn partially exposed, eroded and overgrown over time. Many tombs and mausoleums can be found in this structure which can be looted to sometimes find **Totems of Levitation** that can be used to save you from a fatal fall, or a fall into the void.

An internal staircase connects multiple floors around a central birdcage shaped chamber where each floor branches off into winding passages and rooms.
Trial Spawners that spawn waves of Olvite-equipped [Envoys](/wiki/paradise-lost/mobs/envoy/) frequently generate in side rooms or uncommonly in the main chamber. These Trial Spawners directly provide loot instead of dropping keys like in Trial Chambers.

## Spawning Location
Birdcages can spawn in the following biomes:
* [Highlands](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/highlands/)
* [Highlands Forest](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/highlands-forest/)
* [Wisteria Woods](/wiki/paradise-lost/biomes/wisteria-woods/)

## Inhabitants
Birdcages are populated with trial-spawned [Envoys](/wiki/paradise-lost/mobs/envoy/) wearing Olvite armor and wielding Olvite Swords and Axes.
