A Totem of Levitation pictured in the Birdcage structure where it is obtained.

## Function
While in the main or off hand of a player, the Totem of Levitation will automatically activate and be consumed when a player is falling into the Void or about to take fatal fall damage.

### Triggered by Falling into the Void
If a player is falling into the Void of either Paradise or The End, the Totem of Levitation will activate giving the player a high level of the Levitation potion effect which will pull them up to the surface of the dimension again. After the Levitation wears off, a short duration of Slow Falling will allow the player safely land on the ground again.

### Triggered by Fatal Fall Damage
If a player would recieve fatal fall damage, the Totem of Levitation will activate and give the player a brief moment of slow fall to prevent any fall damage from being taken. 

## Obtaining
Totems of Levitation are loot-only items obtained exclusively from the Trial Spawners and Tomb loot in **[Birdcage](/wiki/paradise-lost/structures/birdcage/)** structures.
