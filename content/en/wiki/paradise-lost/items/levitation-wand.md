## Function
Levitation Wands are used to levitate Blocks or Mobs at a cost of durability. The wand of levitation has **100** max durability, and can be enchanted with Unbreaking and Mending.

### Levitating Blocks
Blocks can be levitated at the cost of 4 durability (reduced by Unbreaking). Levitated blocks will float upwards until they hit a solid block where they will stop. 

Unlike Vanilla falling blocks, levitated blocks can be stood on and are solid which allows them to be used to rapidly gain vertical height.

If a levitated block reaches the world height, it will come to a stop and the accelerate back downwards to land where it was levitated from. Note that this is different from natural levitation from Levita and Levita Ore which will break at world height instead.

### Levitating Mobs
Mobs can be levitated at the cost of 1 durability (reduced by Unbreaking). Levitated mobs will flip upside down and "fall" about 10 blocks upwards before flipping again and falling to the ground. The mob will take fall damage from this height as normal.


## Obtaining
A Levitation Wand is crafted with 2 sticks and 1 Levita Bead which can be obtained by mining Levita ore rarely found in all Paradise biomes.

Levitation Wands are rarely dropped as loot as rewards from the Trial Spawners in **[Birdcage](/wiki/paradise-lost/structures/birdcage/)** structures.
