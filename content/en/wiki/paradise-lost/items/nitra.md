A large farm growing Nitra crops within a player-built house.

## Function
Nitra comes in two forms each with different uses. **Nitra** itself is the plant item from a fully grown Nitra crop, while **Nitra Bunches** are the block form crafted in a 2x2 of Nitra and act similarly to TNT without a fuse.

### Nitra
Nitra items are throwable like Snowballs, Eggs, and Enderpearls. When they impact a block or mob, they explode doing a small amount of damage and repeling mobs. They can be used to jump great heights if thrown below a player's feet, similar to how Wind Charges are used.

### Nitra Bunches
Nitra Bunches act similar to TNT but do not have a fuse, instead detonating instantly with a smaller explosion. Bunches can be ignited with both Flint and Steel and by Redstone. If multiple Bunches are chained together, each subsequent explosion will be smaller than the last to prevent giant instantaneous explosions. Explosion power diminishes quickly, and after 5 Bunches have chained, the 6th has 0 explosion power.

Nitra Bunches can be useful for cheap renewable excavation and for sneaky player traps.

## Obtaining
Nitra is grown from Nitra seeds found commonly in **[Aurel Tower](/wiki/paradise-lost/structures/aurel-tower/)** structures or rarely in **[Birdcage](/wiki/paradise-lost/structures/birdcage/)** structures.

Nitra is planted normally like other crops and has 8 growth states. In it's final growth state it will drop one Nitra Bulb and 1-4 Nitra Seeds.
