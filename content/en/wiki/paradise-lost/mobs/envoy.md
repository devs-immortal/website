A group of Envoys hiding from the sun in a cave near the surface.

## Behavior
Envoys spawn throughout Paradise in dark places and during the night. Outside of structures they wield no weapons, wear no armor, and spawn in small groups of 1-2. Like other skeleton variants they burn up in the day and are afraid of wolves.

### Enlightenment
Some Envoys generated in structures will be **Enlightened** and take half damage from all sources. They are easily distinguished from normal Envoys by their glowing eyes and particle effects. At the moment, Enlightened Envoys are only found protecting the **[Vault Structures](/wiki/paradise-lost/structures/vault/)** in each treasure room.

## Spawn Locations
Envoys can be found in all Paradise Biomes.

Special Spawn Locations:
* **[Vault](/wiki/paradise-lost/structures/vault/)**: Spawns Enlightened with Glazed Gold Armor and Sword in each treasure room
* **[Birdcage](/wiki/paradise-lost/structures/birdcage/)**: Spawn from Trial Spawners with Olvite Armor and Weapons

## Drops
When killed, Envoys will drop 0-2 Bones and have a 1/20 chance to drop a **[Bloomed Calcite](/wiki/paradise-lost/guides/getting-started/)** block.
